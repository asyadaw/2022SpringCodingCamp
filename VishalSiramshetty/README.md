## Machine Learning in Python

In this project we will develop a machine learning model for an endpoint of interest using Python. This involves:

- Programmatically accessing PubChem database (or a similar database,for e.g., ChEMBL) to download drug discovery datasets
- Data preprocessing and calculation of molecular features
- Machine learning to build classification/regression models
- Statistical analyses to assess model performance
